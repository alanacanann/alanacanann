<p><em>This is a picture I took in Split, Croatia. It was a beautiful sunny day, then, all of a sudden, a fire started over the hill right as a storm rolled in.</em></p>

<p>I am a recent UCLA graduate with a B.S. in Cognitive Science with a Specialization in Computing. I am looking for work in UI/UX and am open to relocation.
Among other things, I love to read, travel, play violin, and volunteer.</p>
